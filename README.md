<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The page itself was not that difficult, using basic concepts of HTML5 and positioning with CSS3 it is possible to finish the challenge with peace of mind.</p>

<h4>What i learned?</h4>
<p>This time I was introduced to <i>SVG</i>, which is basically a link to an image that doesn't lose quality regardless of its size, and I had to burn some neurons to do the active-states, which was great because it gave me some experience to solve challenges similar ahead</p>
